<h2>
	A Linux enthusiast
</h2>
<p>
As a Linux enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the power and flexibility of open-source software. I enjoy exploring the world of programming and learning new commands and tools that help me become a more efficient developer. Whether I am creating scripts to automate routine tasks or delving into the intricacies of cloud servers, I remain committed to refining my craft and expanding my knowledge.
<br>
<br>
Currently, I'm in my final year of Diploma in Computer Engineering at Government Polytechnic Mumbai, from where I've started honed my skills in software development and systems administration. During my studies, I've gained experience with a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including C, C++, Java, Python, and Node.js. I've also worked on projects that involve web backend development, mobile app development, and database management.
<br><br>
In my free time, I enjoy reading programming articles and exploring topics related to DevOps and Cybersecurity. I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in these fields and love to share my knowledge with others. Whether it's automating processes, securing applications, or deploying web applications, I enjoy tackling challenges head-on and finding elegant solutions to complex problems.
<br><br>
One of the things that sets me apart from others is my ability to work well both independently and in a team environment. I have excellent communication skills and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve shared goals. I'm also a quick learner, adaptable, and willing to take on new challenges.
<br><br>
If you're looking for a talented and dedicated software developer who can help take your projects to the next level, then I would love to hear from you. Please feel free to contact me to learn more about my work and how I can contribute to your team.
