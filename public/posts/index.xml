      <description>Docker Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. Containers simplify delivery of distributed applications, and have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development and hybrid multicloud environments.
Containers are made possible by process isolation and virtualization capabilities built into the Linux kernel.</description>

      <description>CronJob Cron is a job scheduling utility present in Unix like systems. The crond daemon enables cron functionality and runs in background. The cron reads the crontab (cron tables) for running predefined scripts. Cron is a system that helps Linux users to schedule any task. However, a cron job is any defined task to run in a given time period. It can be a shell script or a simple bash command.</description>
